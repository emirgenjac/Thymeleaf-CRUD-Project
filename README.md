This is a CRUD app built using Spring Boot, Thymeleaf templates and Bootstrap. The database is MySQL and everything is hosted on Railway. 
Of course, there could be many improvements but this is a very basic project.
Take note that the redirect time after performing certain actions is longer than expected. This could be optimised by caching in the future.
The app is available at:
